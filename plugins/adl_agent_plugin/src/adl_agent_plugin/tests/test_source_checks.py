"""
Tests for the ingestion-diagnostic contracts: ``get_source_endpoint()``,
``check_source()``, ``check_station_source()`` and the ``adl_sources_count``
duck-typed handover. See the "Ingestion Diagnostic Contracts" page in the ADL
developer guide.

Convention for everything added to this module: **the tests touch no database**.
Build model instances unsaved and stub the source client, so the seam under test
is exactly the contract core consumes. That means ``SimpleTestCase``, never
``TestCase`` — no fixtures, no per-test migrations. Django still calls
``setup_databases()`` whatever the test class, so the suite is run on this
plugin's own compose stack with ``make test`` from the repo root; "DB-free" is
about what the tests touch, not where they run.

Add one test class per surface this plugin implements, each with a happy path
plus every failure branch it classifies. Surfaces the plugin deliberately
declines get no test: asserting that core still returns ``UNSUPPORTED`` tests
core, not this plugin.

The guard below ships with the scaffold and is correct before any plugin code
exists — it parses the source rather than running it.

        def check_source(self):
